"""This module define BaseModel class which defines all
common attrbute and methods for subclasses.

Module Description:
The BaseModel module defines the foundational class for all other
classes in the project. It contains attributes and methods that are
common to all classes, ensuring consistent behavior and data structure
across instances. The class is responsible for generating unique IDs,
managing creation and modification timestamps, providing a dictionary
representation of instances, and facilitating serialization and
deserialization through JSON.
