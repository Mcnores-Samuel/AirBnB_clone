"""This module define the FileStorage that serializes instances
to a JSON file and deserializes JSON file to instances

Module Description:
The FileStorage module implements a storage mechanism for serializing
instances into a JSON file and deserializing instances from the JSON
file back into memory. This module acts as a bridge between the
object-oriented realm and the persistent storage layer. It offers
methods to store and retrieve instances, maintaining them across program
launches. By converting instances to JSON strings and storing them in a file,
the FileStorage module enables persistence and seamless data recovery.
